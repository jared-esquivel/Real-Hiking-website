          The Byrne-Milliron Forest will be closed to public access from July 1,
          2024 - May 1, 2025 for a sustainable timber harvest. The Land Trusts
          comprehensive forest management plan for the property is based on
          maintaining stand characteristics that maximize productivity yet are
          sustainable over time, which is why the Byrne Forest is thriving.
          Trees have been hand selected for removal so that nearby trees can
          grow more vigorously. Selection depends on the slope, the size of
          nearby trees, the ease of getting them out, the proximity of creeks,
          and more. Ecological benefits of selection forestry include improved
          wildlife habitat and increased carbon sequestration. The harvest is
          being conducted by Big Creek Lumber and overseen by Land Trust staff.

      <h2>No. 2 Forest of Nisene Marks State Park</h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        Off the beaten path, The Forest of Nisene Marks is a refreshing retreat
        from the busy towns and beaches along Highway 1 near Santa Cruz. Its
        dense second- and third-growth redwood forest rises from near sea level
        to steep coastal mountains. Most visitors come to picnic near Aptos
        Creek or to hike, jog, or bike on 30 miles of trails in rugged
        semi-wilderness, rising from sea level to steep coastal mountains of
        more than 2,600 feet. The parks land has a bittersweet beauty. Almost
        all of todays redwood forest was clear-cut in a 40-year logging frenzy
        from 1883 to 1923. When the loggers left the Aptos Canyon, the forest
        began to heal itself; now, the scars grow fainter with each passing
        year. The Forest of Nisene Marks is a monument to forest regeneration
        and the future—it is a forest in a perpetual state of becoming.

      <h2>No. 3 Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park</h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park is located in the Santa Cruz Mountains
        and is most famous for the 40-acre grove of towering old-growth redwood
        trees. Its historical significance and spectacular scenery draw
        travelers from around the world. Visitors can enjoy hiking, horseback
        riding, picnicking, swimming, and camping on more than 4,650 acres of
        forested and open land. These skyscraping redwoods were admired by
        explorer John C. Frémont, President Theodore Roosevelt, and inspired
        some of Californias earliest redwood preservation efforts. Take a walk
        beyond the redwood grove and youll find four diverse habitats that this
        park preserves: grasslands, river/riparian, sandhills, and redwoods. The
        tallest tree in the park is approximately 277 feet tall, about 16 feet
        wide, and around 1,500 years old. Keen-eyed visitors may spot banana
        slugs, black-tailed deer, coyotes, bobcats, or steelhead trout.
